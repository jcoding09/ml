11 questions in total...all related to one dataset

First question was to get count of target variable categories..like how many values belong to class A, class B etc

Then count the total number of null values

Second question was scatter plot

Third was to create a new column from an existing column then assign values based on some conditions...for eg: assign 'small' for values < 12, medium for 12>values>15, and large for remaining.... basically data discretization

4th question was removing null values, label encoding, scaling data, and storing it into X and y

5th question was splitting into test and train sets

6th was Logistic regression, 7th was Random forest, 8th was gradientBoostingClassifier

In these questions we had to fit the model, create classification report and confusion matrix

9th was choosing the best model out of the three...this was MCQ question...we had to select one option

10th was retraining the gradient boosting classifier model
```

## : MCQ 202305:

```
This time it was mostly based on machine learning and it's core concept. MCQs were in detail and weightage of numpy and matplotlib questions were less.
Topics ranged from :
Numpy, data visualization using seaborn and matplotlib both, ML concepts , NLP  , regularisation both lasso and ridge along with their penalties 
Stemming in detail from NLP
```

## : MCQ 202308:

```
Topics ranged from :
Nltk tokenize
Sklearn impute
Scipy linalgo
Numpy arr argument
Matplotlib
Pd dataframe concat, buffer
Pd series
Pd sparse series
Evaluation metrics
Chatbot rasa
```

## : hands on:

```
Questions were based on confusion matrix but we're situation based you had to analysis which measure of confusion matrix they are talking about

Once you find that then you have to implement that on given data set

6 questions were based on confusion matrix and measures (sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix)

Last one we had to build a machine learning model ( including pre processing of the data. ) (train test split, regression model creation)

Which was measured on basis of weighted F1 score
```

## : Observation :

```
Usually they ask numpy and matplotlib mostly but this the focus was on machine learning (ML)

suggestion to do both ML and numpy & data visualization(matplotlib)
```

## : How to prepare :

```
Before going to ML model : try and practice numpy and pandas learn data manipulation

Then go to model building as it requires preprocessing, feature engineering and feature scaling

For practising model building kaggle is best 
```
